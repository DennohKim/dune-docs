## Limitations

- Currently, these endpoints only support EVM-compatible chains.
- These endpoints are optimized for micro-batch uploads, featuring sub-second processing times and supporting a maximum batch size of approximately 1.2GB â€” ideal for chains with block times of 1-2 seconds.
- currently hosted chains don't have access to decoded tables
- hosted chains cannot be used in spellbook
