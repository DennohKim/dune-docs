title: Troubleshooting Errors
---

Dune uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general: Codes in the `2xx` range indicate success. Codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error that failed given the information provided. Codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with Dune's servers.

| HTTP Status Code | Status             | Description                                                     |
|------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| 200              | OK                 | Everything worked as expected.                                  |
| 400              | Bad Request        | The request was unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter. |
| 401              | Unauthorized       | No valid API key provided.                                      |
| 402              | Payment Required   | This request would exceed your configured limits per billing cycle.            |
| 403              | Forbidden          | The API key doesn’t have permissions to perform the request.    |
| 404              | Not Found          | The requested resource doesn’t exist.                           |
| 409              | Conflict           | The request conflicts with another request.                     |
| 429              | Too Many Requests  | Too many requests hit the API too quickly (rate limited).                     |
| 500              | Server Errors      | Generic internal server error.                                  |

For specific error code information, please refer to each of the endpoint itself. Here we list some common errors and suggest possible solution:

#### Invalid API key
```json
{
  "error": "invalid API Key"
}
```
You did not input a valid API key. You can go generate a new key and make sure you save it in a safe place and paste the key over.

#### Result too large 
```json
{
  "execution_id": "01HMF87Y5WW6NQ7VQ35Z691JER",
  "query_id": 3362169,
  "state": "QUERY_STATE_FAILED",
  "submitted_at": "2024-01-18T21:39:41.885699Z",
  "expires_at": "2024-04-17T21:40:15.146884Z",
  "execution_started_at": "2024-01-18T21:39:41.905154Z",
  "execution_ended_at": "2024-01-18T21:40:15.146883Z",
  "error": {
    "type": "FAILED_TYPE_RESULT_SIZE_EXCEEDED",
    "message": "Result is too large and was truncated to 1.0GiB. Set allow_partial_results=true query parameter to get the partial result."
  }
}
```
The result for the query exceeds the 1GB limit. If you'd like to get partial, truncated result, please set `allow_partial_results` to true. 


#### Permission error
```json
{
"error": "not found: Query not found or private"
}
```
When you perform an action to a private query your API key doesn't have access to, you will get this error. If you indeed own this query, please check the context of the API key and the query owner are the same. 


#### Credit limit error
```json
{
  "error": "This api request would exceed your configured limits per billing cycle. Please visit your settings on dune.com and adjust your limits to continue usage."
}
```
You are trying to make a request but don't have enough credits (configured) on your account. If you'd like to incur overage, head over to settings -> subscription and adjust the limit you have set within "limit extra credits" toggle.
