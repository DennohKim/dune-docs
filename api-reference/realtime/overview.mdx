Duneâ€™s multi-chain, realtime APIs are focused on providing critical information for accounts (wallets).

<Note> 
- These endpoints are in beta and accessible on a free-trial basis, please contact realtimeAPI@dune.com to get access today. 
</Note>

The two APIs available today are:

1. [Token balances API](./balances): Access accurate and fast (sub 500ms) real time balances of the native and ERC20 tokens of accounts on EVM blockchains.
2. Transactions and events API: Access realtime transactions for a given account or subscribe to transactions given input filters.

<Tip>
    - Currently, the token balances supports 8 EVM-compatible chains: avalanche_c, base, bnb, ethereum, polygon, optimism, celo
    - The response time of the API is sub 500ms
