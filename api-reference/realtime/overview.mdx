Duneâ€™s realtime multi-chain APIs focus on providing critical information about accounts (wallets).

The two APIs available today are:

1. [Token balances API](./balances): Access accurate and fast (sub 500ms) real time balances of the native and ERC20 tokens of accounts on EVM blockchains.
2. [Chains API](./chains): The endpoint lists the supported blockchains for the token balances API
3. Transactions API: Access realtime transactions for a given account or subscribe to transactions given input filters.

<Note> 
- These endpoints are in beta and accessible on a free-trial basis, please contact realtimeAPI@dune.com to get access today. 
</Note>
<Tip>
    - Currently, the token balances supports 8 EVM-compatible chains: avalanche_c, base, bnb, ethereum, polygon, optimism, celo and many more. use the /chains endpoint to see.
