title: 'Token Balances API (Beta)'
openapi: 'GET /beta/balance/{address}'
---

The Token Balances API provides accurate and fast real time balances of the native and ERC20 tokens of accounts on supported blockchains (EVM currently).

<Note>
  - As we are in beta there might be many changes. 
  - Supply `?all_chains` to get native balances for a long tail of evm chains.
  - Currently no spam filtering available 
  - We are using CoinMarketCap for price information
  - Token metadata, such as symbols and decimals, are fetched from Dune.
</Note>
