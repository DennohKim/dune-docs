<ParamField path="block_date">
Block event date in UTC
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="block_time">
Timestamp for block event time in UTC
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="block_epoch">
A specific epoch during which this block was proposed. An epoch is a division of time in Ethereum&#x27;s Proof of Stake mechanism.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="block_slot">
A slot in which a validator has the opportunity to propose a new block. Each slot represents a chance for a block to be added.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="index">
Index of the blob in the block slot
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="proposer_index">
Identifier for the validator that proposed the specific block.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="kzg_commitment">
A cryptographic commitment used to ensure data integrity within blob transactions. KZG commitments are a form of cryptographic proof used to represent blob data within blocks.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="kzg_commitment_inclusion_proof">
A cryptographic proof that verifies the inclusion of the KZG commitment within the block.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="kzg_proof">
A cryptographic proof associated with the KZG commitment, used to validate the data within blob transactions.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="body_root">
A cryptographic hash representing the aggregated transactions (including blob transactions) within the block.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="parent_root">
A hash of the parent block, linking the current block to the previous one in the blockchain.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="state_root">
A cryptographic hash representing the entire state of the system after the block&#x27;s transactions have been applied.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="signature">
A digital signature of the block proposer, verifying the authenticity and integrity of the block.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="blob">
Content of the blob, large data packets used in blob-carrying transactions.
</ParamField>
