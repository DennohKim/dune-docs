description: Quickly take control of your blockchain data using our Hosted solution, seamlessly integrating with Dune's robust infrastructure.
---

The **Hosted** option enables blockchain teams to easily make their data available on Dune via an **Integration Toolkit**. All the team or a RaaS provider needs to do is spin up a Docker container from this [Node Indexer](https://github.com/duneanalytics/node-indexer) with the required configuration, and the data will start flowing to Dune in batch mode.

## Key Features

- **Self-Serve Flexibility**: Publish and manage your data independently, supported by Dune's robust infrastructure.
- **Quick to Market**: Accelerate your go-to-market strategy by cutting down on turnaround time.

## Technical Requirements

- Your chain is EVM compatible
- Your chain has an RPC provider that supports the following three calls:
  - `eth_getBlockReceipts`
  - `debug_traceBlockByNumber`
  - `eth_getBlockByNumber`
- Your chain is running on the OP Stack, Arbitrum Orbit, Polygon CDK, or zkSync ZK stack 
<Warning>The Docker [Node Indexer](https://github.com/duneanalytics/node-indexer) currently only supports the OP Stack, with more support for other stacks coming soon.</Warning>

## Integration Toolkit

There are three components in the toolkit. The blockchain team or a RaaS provider is responsible for the first two components while Dune manages the third component.

<Info>Please head to the [README on the Node Indexer](https://github.com/duneanalytics/node-indexer) to learn more about how to use it.</Info>

1. **Config**: Inputs required from the blockchain team:
   - `DUNE_API_KEY`: Your Dune API Key, available at [https://dune.com/settings/api](https://dune.com/settings/api)
   - `BLOCKCHAIN_NAME`: The name of the blockchain as configured on Dune (e.g., "ethereum").
   - `RPC_NODE_URL`: The URL of the RPC endpoints (e.g., [https://mainnet.mode.network/](https://mainnet.mode.network/))
<Note>Please work with the Dune team to obtain the proper blockchain name and API key with the right access.</Note>

2. **Node Indexer**: Does the heavy lifting of indexing the chain data and sending it to Dune
   - Provided as a [Docker image](https://github.com/duneanalytics/node-indexer) in Dune’s registry
   - Run by the customer/RAAS on their preferred platform
   - Configured to connect to the specific RPC node and stack (e.g., OP)
   - Makes relevant RPC calls (`eth_getBlockReceipts`, `debug_traceBlockByNumber`, `eth_getBlockByNumber`)
   - Forwards data to the Dune API
<Tip>We recommend running the indexer close to EU cloud regions (optimally AWS eu-west-1) to avoid large data egress costs.</Tip>

3. **Blockchain Endpoints**:
   - API that accepts RPC call responses, transforms the data to match Dune’s schema, and uploads it continuously to Dune
   - Creates four raw tables on Dune: `<chain>.blocks`, `<chain>.transactions`, `<chain>.traces`, `<chain>.logs`
<Note>Blockchain teams don't need to worry about the Blockchain endpoints; the Node Indexer handles writing to the endpoints and transforming the RPC calls into the predefined raw tables with predefined schemas for EVM chains.</Note>

## Limitations

Before we dive into the limitations, it's helpful to understand that Dune has three layers of data: Raw, [Decoded](../data-catalog/evm/ethereum/decoded/overview), and [Curated](../data-catalog/curated/overview).

It's also useful to compare what the [Fully Managed](./fully-managed) option provides versus the Hosted option in terms of these data layers. The Hosted option includes raw data, with manual decoding available, and does not include curated data.

| Data Layer    | Fully Managed                   | Hosted                                                         |
|---------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Raw**       | Yes                              | Yes, but users get a warning that data is not indexed by Dune. |
| **Decoded**   | Yes. Automatic.                  | Yes. Manual.                                                   |
| **Curated**   | Yes                              | No.                                                            |

Therefore, the limitations of Hosted chains are:

- No automatic decoded tables; analysts must [manually decode protocol data](../query-engine/Functions-and-operators/evm-decoding-functions) in DuneSQL, requiring advanced skills.
- Cannot be used within Dune's Spellbook (i.e. Curated data), limiting advanced querying capabilities. For example, Uniswap on Base can be included in `dex.trades`, but KIM on Mode cannot.
