## Why Websockets?
Using WebSockets for a balances and transactions API enables real-time, bidirectional communication between the server and clients, 
ensuring that updates are instantaneously pushed to users. 

This is crucial for blockchain applications, where timely updates on balances 
and transactions are essential for user experience and trust. 

Unlike traditional HTTP requests, WebSockets maintain an open connection, 
reducing latency and overhead associated with repeatedly establishing connections. 
This efficiency and immediacy make WebSockets an ideal choice for
 dynamic and interactive blockchain applications.

## What are Websockets and how do they differ from HTTP?
WebSockets operate as a two-way communication protocol, keeping a persistent connection between a server and a client. 
This differs from HTTP, where clients must repeatedly send requests to receive information.

With an active WebSocket connection, clients can receive real-time updates by subscribing to specific network states, 
like new transactions or blockchain blocks being added.

## Getting Started
We prepared examples for getting websocket updates in your terminal, python or javascript to help you get started with our Developer Websockets Endpoints.
Pick your preferred language, complete the steps below and you should be able to get your first events streamed to your client.
