# Snapshot
[Snapshot](https://snapshot.org) - a decentralized voting platform that enables off-chain, gasless voting for decentralized governance.

Snapshot is pivotal for communities to make collective decisions effectively without the high costs associated with on-chain votes. It operates on IPFS, ensuring that proposals and votes are tamper-proof and easily accessible.
