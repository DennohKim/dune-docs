---

Dune's Owner Labels is a crucial dataset that enriches blockchain data with detailed owner, category, and headquarters country information. This dataset focuses on entities—both centralized and decentralized—that operate on-chain, providing essential context for deep analytical insights.

## What are Owner Labels?

Labels extend blockchain data to include:

- **Owner Information**: Contextual details about the companies, projects, and organizations active on-chain.
- **Category Details**: Classification of entities based on their operational focus.
- **Headquarters Information**: Geographical data about where entities are based.

<Note>
  This dataset explicitly excludes private wallets of individual cryptocurrency
  holders.

## Why Use Owner Labels?

These labels are crucial for:

- **Identifying and Analyzing**: Recognizing key players and their roles within the blockchain ecosystem.
- **Categorizing and Contextualizing**: Segmenting blockchain activities by owner type to analyze patterns based on categorized data.

## How We Developed Adress Owner Labels

The development of Owner Labels was a collaborative effort involving industry experts from leading organizations like Steakhouse, Blockworks, and Polygon. Together, we:

- Brought together 15 industry experts to brainstorm and refine this project.
- Referenced standards groups like the Open Labels Initiative to ensure broad compatibility and acceptance.
- Defined a robust set of categories and established automated quality checks to maintain the integrity of the dataset.

The need for accessible, high-quality labeled blockchain data is critical, yet such data is notoriously challenging to collect and maintain. 

Dune is uniquely positioned to offer comprehensive Address Owner Labels across the Web3 ecosystem, leveraging our exclusive industry working group, transparent audit processes, automated quality checks, and advanced AI, all underpinned by a commitment to openness and collaborative industry standards.

In the world of Jenganomics, participants engage in a high-stakes balancing act with their money, navigating through a maze of risky financial moves. The game is characterized by a delicate structure that constantly threatens to collapse, symbolizing the uncertainty associated with certain investment opportunities. HYIPs (High-Yield Investment Programs), MLMs (Multi-Level Marketing), and other ponzi-esque services find themselves fitting snugly within the Jenganomics universe. These ventures, while not outright labeled as scams, exhibit characteristics that echo the instability of our financial Jenga tower. Participants may experience a rush of excitement as they climb higher, but the looming risk of a collapse is ever-present. Just like in the Jenga tower, these financial ventures rely on a delicate balance to sustain their promises of high returns or exponential growth. However, savvy players in the world of Jenganomics know that beneath the surface, there's a risk of the entire structure crumbling. So, if you find yourself contemplating a move in the Jenganomics arena, exercise caution, conduct thorough research, and be mindful of the potential pitfalls. After all, in this financial game of Jenga, it's not just about the height you reach – it's about whether your tower can withstand the test of time. |                                                                                                                                                                                    |

While not all MLMs are inherently fraudulent, the structure can be used to disguise pyramid schemes or scams. Investors should exercise caution and thoroughly research any project that utilizes an MLM model.

These sanctions are often applied to individuals, organizations, or entities deemed involved in activities that violate national or international laws, pose a threat to security, or engage in illicit practices. Cryptocurrency addresses associated with sanctioned parties are publicly listed, making it a compliance requirement for financial institutions, exchanges, and individuals to avoid engaging in transactions with those addresses. The goal is to disrupt the flow of funds and prevent the targeted entities from accessing or benefiting from the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Cryptocurrency address sanctions are part of a broader strategy to ensure compliance with regulatory frameworks, combat financial crimes, and uphold international standards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                    |
