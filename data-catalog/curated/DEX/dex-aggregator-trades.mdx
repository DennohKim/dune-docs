# dex_aggregator.trades Table

The `dex_aggregator.trades` table captures high-level trade data executed via decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregators. These aggregators aggregate liquidity from multiple DEXs to provide users with the best possible trade execution. Unlike the `dex.trades` table, which records each intermediary step of a trade, `dex_aggregator.trades` condenses the trade data to reflect the user's intended trade, presenting it as a single entry.

## Table Description

The `dex_aggregator.trades` table provides a simplified view of trades by recording the user's initial token sold and final token bought, without detailing the intermediary swaps across different DEXs.

### Functional Overview

Users can expect the `dex_aggregator.trades` table to provide a high-level view of DEX trades facilitated by aggregators. This table simplifies trade records by showing a single entry for trades that may involve multiple DEXs and liquidity pools. For instance, a user might initiate a trade to swap USDC for PEPE via a DEX aggregator. The aggregator might route this trade through several liquidity pools such as WETH-USDC and WETH-PEPE, but `dex_aggregator.trades` will record it as a single USDC -> PEPE trade.
