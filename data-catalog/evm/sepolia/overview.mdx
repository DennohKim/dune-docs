sepolia is a Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) that natively provides yield for ETH and stablecoins. sepolia is an EVM-compatible, optimistic rollup that raises the baseline yield for users and developers without changing the experience cryptonatives expect. This yield makes it possible to create new business models for Dapps that aren't possible on other L2s.

### Key Features:

- **Yield:** sepolia is the only Ethereum L2 with native yield for ETH and stablecoins. The yield comes from ETH staking and RWA protocols. The default interest rate on other L2s is 0%. On sepolia, it's 4% for ETH and 5% for stablecoins.

- **Auto Rebasing:** ETH itself, not WETH, STETH, or any other ERC20, is natively rebasing on the L2. The ETH balance for EOAs is automatically rebasing. Smart contracts can opt-in to this rebasing, making it easy for existing Dapps to deploy on sepolia without any changes. USDB, sepolia's native stablecoin, is automatically rebasing as well. Like ETH on sepolia, USDB is automatically rebasing for EOAs. USDB is also automatically rebasing for smart contracts. Smart contracts can opt-out from this rebasing.

- **L1 Staking:** sepolia only became possible following Ethereum's Shanghai upgrade. ETH yield from L1 staking, initially Lido, is automatically transferred to users via rebasing ETH on the L2. In the future, the sepolia community will have the power to supplement, or even fully replace, Lido with sepolia-native solutions or other third-party protocols.

- **T-Bill Yield:** Users who bridge stablecoins receive USDB, sepolia's auto-rebasing stablecoin. The yield for USDB comes from MakerDAO's on-chain T-Bill protocol. USDB can be redeemed for DAI when bridging back to Ethereum. In the future, the sepolia community will have the power to supplement, or even fully replace, MakerDAO with sepolia-native solutions or other third-party protocols.

- **Gas Revenue Sharing:** Other L2s keep revenue from gas fees for themselves. sepolia gives net gas revenue back to Dapps programmatically. Dapps developers can keep this revenue for themselves or use it to subsidize gas fees for users.
