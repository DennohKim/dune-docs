## Introduction to EVM Chains

The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the runtime environment for smart contracts in Ethereum. It's not only the cornerstone of Ethereum but also serves as a standard for decentralized applications across various blockchain networks. Due to its robustness and developer-friendly attributes, numerous blockchains have adopted the EVM framework, enabling them to leverage Ethereum's thriving ecosystem and interoperability.

## EVM Chains We Index

Our platform provides comprehensive data analytics across an extensive range of EVM-compatible chains. By indexing these chains, we offer deep insights into the smart contract transactions and state changes that occur within these diverse ecosystems. Currently, we support the following EVM chains:

- Arbitrum
- Avalanche C-Chain
- BNB Chain
- Base
- Celo
- Ethereum
- Fantom
- Gnosis Chain
- Goerli
- Optimism
- Optimism (legacy)
- Polygon
- Scroll
- Zora
- zkSync

Each chain brings unique offerings to the blockchain space, from scalability solutions like layer-two protocols and sidechains to entirely new frameworks for decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and beyond.

## Utilizing EVM Chain Data

Developers, analysts, and enthusiasts can explore the indexed data from these chains for various purposes:

- **Smart Contract Development**: By examining transactions and contract interactions, developers can optimize their smart contracts.
- **Market Analysis**: Traders and investors can analyze token movements, liquidity patterns, and DApp metrics.
- **Research**: Academics and analysts can study network activity, DeFi trends, and blockchain growth factors.

Our platform ensures that the data from these chains is accessible, queryable, and analyzable to empower your blockchain-related endeavors with actionable insights.
