Mantle Network is dedicated to building an EVM-compatible scaling solution for Ethereum. This means that all contracts and tools running on Ethereum can operate on the Mantle Network with minimal modifications. Taking advantage of its modular architecture, Mantle Network combines an optimistic rollup with various innovative data availability solutions, providing cheaper and more accessible data availability while inheriting the security of Ethereum.

Our protocol design philosophy aims to offer users a less costly and more user-friendly experience, provide developers with a simpler and more flexible development environment, and deliver a comprehensive set of infrastructure for the next wave of mass-adopted dApps.

As an Ethereum L2, Mantle Network offers the security, stability, and scalability necessary to support your onchain applications. Developers can deploy any EVM-compatible codebase and smoothly transition users and assets from Ethereum L1 and other compatible chains.

**Big Features, Small Fees:**
Mantle Network provides an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) environment at significantly lower costs. It introduces early access to new Ethereum features such as Account Abstraction (ERC4337), developer-friendly APIs for gasless transactions, and advanced smart contract wallets.

**Open Source Commitment:**
Built on a modular architecture, Mantle Network separates transaction execution, consensus, settlement, and storage into individual modules. This modular approach allows for independent innovation and flexibility.

**Scaled by Ethereum:**
Mantle Network leverages Ethereum's robust infrastructure to offer decentralized apps enhanced product integration, straightforward fiat onramps, and access to a vast network of users within the Ethereum ecosystem.
