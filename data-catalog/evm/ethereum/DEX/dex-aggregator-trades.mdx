The dex_aggregator.trades table is pivotal for analyzing the operations and impact of cryptocurrency aggregator platforms like 1inch or CowSwap. These aggregators optimize trade execution by pooling liquidity from various decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to offer users better pricing and reduced slippage.

## Table specifics

The `dex_aggregator.trades` table captures the intents of users to swap tokens on a DEX aggregator platform. It records the details of the trade, including the user's address, the tokens being swapped, the amount of tokens swapped, the price, and the timestamp of the trade.

In this table you will not find the details of the trade execution, for that you will have to join `dex.trades` and this table on the `tx_hash` column.
